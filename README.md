A Flow solver
---

The source code for an (unofficial) solver I'm working on for the mobile puzzle game "Flow."

If you want to try it out, click <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B9M-PlzkHv3ZcTYycHRKUk1CWFE&usp=sharing">here</a> for the uberjars.

The current version is 0.1.1.

Usage
---

Option 1: Turn on flow labels in the game, and type in the characters (with no spaces between), one line per row, with a space character or the * character as an empty cell.

Option 2: Enter in (or browse for) the filename of a screenshot on your phone of the game itself. You'll need to enter in the grid size, and whether or not your version of Flow has ads (it turns out that matters in order to read the grid), and the character-grid box will be automatically filled. This feature is currently only available for screenshots of the game on iOS (including iPhone, iPhone 5, and iPad resolutions).
